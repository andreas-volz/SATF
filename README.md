# SATF
Sprite Animation Transmission Format

This project offers one solution for the problem to transfer 2D animations based on sprite sheets from one tool stack / framework to another. A tool could use this format direct or just import it into it's own format.

The first example implementation toolchain is:

* Blender 3D => SATF => Godot 2D

This project will concentrate on defining a JSON format and offer some example implementations.
